  This Web application is a questions forum for developers to ask code related questions and other users can answer the question in the comments section. Anyone can view the questions and comments but to make a post or comment a user must create an account or log in to their account.

  ## Installation:

  ## Usage

  ---
  Users make use of this full stack application by signing in to the page with an email and password which is encrypted on the backend. Once logged in a user can create posts and comments or edit and delete them aswell and all changes are added to the database so that other users see the changes. Users cannot use any vulgar speech aswell as we have curse words banned and filtered out to censor them.
